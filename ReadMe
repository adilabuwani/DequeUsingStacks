# DequeUsingStacks
:) Data Structures in Action 


we have already learned how to implement a deque using a linked list or an array. Well why not twist it a bit?
we can also use stacks to implement a deque which is what I will do this assignment. 

I first start off by implementing a queue using stacks since there are only two methods which inserts or removes
a value from the queue rather than the four methods which inserts or removes a value from the deque.
